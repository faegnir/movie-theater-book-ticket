# movie-theater-book-ticket

School project.

Simple movie theater ticket booking system written in C language.
It stores data by adding them to .txt files.
This program has many essential points that belong to C language and it's been very informative for me.


The features of this simple system, the user can book movie tickets. The user has to login to the app, on its first login, the user has to create a password and should remember it
even though after closing program.

Then on the main menu the user can choose book a ticket option, after that the user has to choose the saloon and the session. 
Next, the user has to enter if he/she is a student or not. That will conclude the booking process and the program will pretend to take the pay, according to age status of user.

After user booked his ticket, the administrator of the program should see the user's place and the session on the "current movie watchers" section.
The administrator can also see total revenue of the movie theater.
